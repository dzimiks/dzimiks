### Hi, my name is Vanja üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! üéâ 

I'm a software engineer with 5+ years of diverse, professional experience. I'm always striving to make things faster, simpler, and more user and developer-friendly.

UI development is the most enjoyable part of my career. I always strive to write well-designed, performant, fully tested code that works across multiple browsers. For the past couple of years, I have been focused on React and Redux development but I am well-versed in many other libraries/frameworks.

More recently, I'm interested in blockchain development and the whole of its ideology. Right now, I'm working on a tool for real-time monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting for Smart Contracts.

Despite enjoying the front end, I tend to float toward whatever project needs the most attention, taking ownership and ensuring success, regardless of comfort level. I regularly develop on OSX and deploy across a variety of platforms. This has required close collaboration with a multitude of stakeholders, which includes security engineers, technical architects, product owners, managers, and designers from all around the world.

The end result is a wide variety of experiences, from REST-based microservice development to writing test automation frameworks, large database migrations, authentication and authorization, and more.

I do not mind jumping in and getting my hands dirty in existing projects. I thrive under pressure and love fast-paced companies that deliver compelling products.

I'm currently working as a **Frontend Engineer** at [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co). üë®‚Äçüíª
