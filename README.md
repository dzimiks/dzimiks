### Hi, my name is Vanja, but you may know me as Jimmy! ðŸ‘‹

I have 8+ years of diverse, professional experience across frontend engineering and developer relations, where I've consistently aimed to make technology faster, simpler, and more user-friendly.

Throughout my career, UI development has been my passion. I take pride in crafting well-designed, performant, and thoroughly tested code that ensures compatibility across multiple platforms. My journey has been marked by a deep focus on React and NextJS, alongside proficiency in a variety of other libraries and frameworks.

A couple of years ago, my interests have expanded into the web3 and blockchain domains, embracing the innovative spirit and ideology of decentralized development. As a Senior Developer Advocate, I have been instrumental in helping developers build faster and more effectively within the Ethereum ecosystem.

My approach is holistic and adaptable; I gravitate towards projects requiring immediate attention, ensuring their success by taking full ownership, irrespective of my comfort level. My experience spans across a multitude of technical landscapes, involving collaboration with security engineers, technical architects, product owners, and designers from around the globe.

I thrive in dynamic, fast-paced environments, and am not hesitant to dive into existing projects. My drive and ability to perform under pressure complement my dedication to delivering compelling, impactful products.
